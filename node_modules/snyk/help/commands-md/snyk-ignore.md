# snyk-ignore(1) -- Modifies the .snyk policy to ignore stated issues

## SYNOPSIS

`snyk` `ignore` `--id`=<ISSUE_ID> \[`--expiry`=<EXPIRY>\] \[`--reason`=<REASON>\] \[<OPTIONS>\]

## DESCRIPTION

Ignore a certain issue, according to its snyk ID for all occurrences. This will update your local `.snyk` to contain a similar block:

```yaml
ignore:
  '<ISSUE_ID>':
    - '*':
        reason: <REASON>
        expires: <EXPIRY>
```

## OPTIONS

  Snyk ID for the issue to ignore. Required.

- `--expiry`=<EXPIRY>:
  Expiry date, according to [RFC2822](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822)

- `--reason`=<REASON>:
  Human-readable <REASON> to ignore this issue.

## EXAMPLES

- `Ignore a specific vulnerability`:

## EXIT CODES

Possible exit codes and their meaning:

**0**: success, no vulns found<br />
**1**: action_needed, vulns found<br />
**2**: failure, try to re-run command<br />
**3**: failure, no supported projects detected<br />


## ENVIRONMENT

You can set these environment variables to change CLI run settings. These keys will override settings in your `snyk config`:

- `SNYK_TOKEN`:
  Snyk authorization token. Setting this envvar will override the token that may be available in your `snyk config` settings.

- `SNYK_API`:
  Sets API host to use for Snyk requests. Useful for on-premise instances and configuring proxies.

- `SNYK_CFG_`<KEY>:
  Allows you to override any key that's also available as `snyk config` option.

  E.g. `SNYK_CFG_ORG`=myorg will override default org option in `config` with "myorg".
